# Backend
App backend is composed of four main parts
- [**passport**](#Security) confuguration with *JWT strategy*
- [**Neo4j**](#Neo4j) configuration
- [**MongoDB**](#Mongodb) configuration
- [**socket.io**](#Websockets) configuration

<h2 id="Dependencies-Backend">Dependencies</h2>

- cors *^2.8.5*
- express *^4.18.2*
- http *^0.0.1-security*
- dotenv *^16.0.3*
- passport *^0.6.0*
- passport-jwt *^4.0.1*
- jsonwebtoken *^9.0.0*
- bcryptjs *^2.4.3*
- mongoose *^6.9.0*
- neo4j-driver *^5.5.0*
- socket.io *^4.5.4*

<h2 id="Setup-Backend">Setup</h2>

1. After cloning repository run `npm i` in *backend* directory
2. Set up databases
- Setup **mongoDB** database on your local machine or in Docker container with `docker run --name Genealogical_Service_MongoDB -p 27017:27017 mongo`
- Setup **Neo4j** database on your local machine or in Docker container with `docker run --name Genealogical_Service_Neo4j -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/s3cr3t-p455w0r0 neo4j`
3. Optionally create *.env* file to change default data
```
NEO4J_URI = 'bolt://localhost:7687'
NEO4J_USER = 'neo4j'
NEO4J_PASSWORD = 's3cr3t-p455w0r0'

MONGO_HOST = '127.0.0.1'
MONGO_PORT = 27017
MONGO_DATABASE = 'projekt'

SECRET = '3p53k63nai6l0w8b1n68'

PORT = 5000
```
4. Run `node index.js`

## Security
Backend is securied with *passport* using JWT strategy. Users passwords are safely stored in database encrypted and salted with *bcryptjs*. All backend routes *(beside two routes for signing in and logging in)* are protected with use of middleware.

## Websockets
Backend allows users to chat in one global chat or create private chat rooms. All private chat rooms are dynamicaly created when needed.

## Data structure
### Mongodb
### **User**
column name | data type | null?
--- | --- | ---
_id  | ObjectId | ‚ùå
name | String | ‚ùå
surname | String | ‚ùå
login | String | ‚ùå
password | String | ‚ùå
birthdate | String | ‚úîÔ∏è

### **Chat**
column name | data type | null?
--- | --- | ---
_id  | ObjectId | ‚ùå
members | Array | ‚ùå
history | Array | ‚ùå

### Neo4j
- **Nodes labels**
  - Root - root node of a user that is created along with users creation, cant be deleted on frontend side
  - Person - main label that marks all people
  - Male - label for males
  - Female - label for females

Gender labels are improving searching performance.

- **Nodes properties**

property name | data type | null?
--- | --- | ---
id  | Integer | ‚ùå
name | String | ‚ùå
birthDate | String | ‚ùå
userId | String | ‚ùå
rootNode | Boolean | ‚úîÔ∏è

- **Nodes relationships**
  - Child
  - Father
  - Mother
  - PossibleChild
  - PossibleFather
  - PossibleMother
